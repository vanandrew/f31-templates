\section*{Resource Sharing Plan}

\textbf{NIH considers the sharing of unique research resources developed through NIH-sponsored
research an important means to enhance the value and further the advancement of the research.
When resources have been developed with NIH funds and the associated research findings
published or provided to NIH, it is important that they be made readily available for research
purposes to qualified individuals within the scientific community. }

Links to direct researchers to these resources will be shared wherever results are presented or published.
